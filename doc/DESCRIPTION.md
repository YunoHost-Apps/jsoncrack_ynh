- Convert: Seamlessly transform data formats, like JSON to CSV or XML to JSON, for easy sharing.
- Format & Validate: Beautify and validate JSON, YAML, and CSV for clear and accurate data.
- Code Generation: Generate TypeScript interfaces, Golang structs, and JSON Schema.
- JSON Schema: Create JSON Schema, mock data, and validate various data formats.
- Advanced Tools: Decode JWT, randomize data, and run jq or JSON path queries.
- Export Image: Download your visualization as PNG, JPEG, or SVG.
- Privacy: All data processing is performed client-side; nothing is stored on the server.
